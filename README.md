# Emily + Matthew's Wedding Site

Welcome to the official repository for Emily and Matthew's wedding website, created for their special day on May 26. This project is designed to be a dynamic, easy-to-update site that shares all the essential wedding details and keeps guests informed.

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the source code for a wedding website deployed via the v0.dev platform, backend configured using Supabase, and hosted on Vercel. The website offers a user-friendly interface where guests can find event information, RSVP, and receive updates.

The main features of Emily and Matthew's wedding website include the following features:

- **Event Information**: Clear details of the wedding date, time, and venue locations, including maps or directions to help guests navigate where the ceremony and reception are taking place.
- **RSVP Tool**: An integrated feature allowing guests to easily respond to invitations online, including options for meal preferences and RSVP deadlines to streamline guest management.
- **Schedule of Events**: A timeline or itinerary for the wedding day (and possibly surrounding events) that informs guests about ceremony start times, receptions, after parties, and other planned activities.
- **Venue Showcase**: Photos and descriptions of the wedding venue to give guests a preview and build excitement.
- **Love Story \& Bridal Party Bios**: Personal pages sharing how the couple met, the proposal story, and introductions to the wedding party members with photos and short bios to connect guests to the people involved.
- **Wedding Registry Links**: Clear access to the couple’s gift registry or honeymoon fund information for convenient gifting.
- **Travel \& Accommodation Information**: Recommendations for hotels, transportation options, shuttle services, and local attractions for out-of-town guests.
- **FAQ Section**: Answers to common guest questions regarding dress code, parking, kids attendance, accessibility, and any social media guidelines for the event.
- **Design Consistency**: The site’s visual style is coordinated with the wedding’s theme or venue ambiance for a cohesive and welcoming experience.

These features create a comprehensive, user-friendly hub for guests to find everything they need for the wedding celebration, reducing confusion and increasing guest engagement before the event.
