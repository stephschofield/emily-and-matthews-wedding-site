# Task 007: Improve Email Invitation Styling

**Status:** To Do  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Created:** January 5, 2026

## Description
Update the email invitations sent to guests to have prettier, more visually appealing styling that matches the wedding website aesthetic.

## Requirements
- [ ] Design email template with elegant typography matching the website (Cormorant Garamond font family)
- [ ] Add wedding color scheme (sage green, cream, slate)
- [ ] Include decorative elements (floral dividers, elegant borders)
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for mobile email clients
- [ ] Test across major email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
- [ ] Include proper branding and wedding details

## Current State
Email confirmations are functional but use basic HTML styling without the wedding theme.

## Technical Considerations
- Use inline CSS for maximum email client compatibility
- Consider using MJML or similar email framework for responsive design
- Test deliverability and spam scores
- Ensure images are hosted and accessible
- Add fallback text for clients that don't support HTML
