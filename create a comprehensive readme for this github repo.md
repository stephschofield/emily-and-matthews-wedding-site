# Emily + Matthew's Wedding Site

Welcome to the official repository for Emily and Matthew's wedding website, created for their special day on May 26. This project is designed to be a dynamic, easy-to-update site that shares all the essential wedding details and keeps guests informed.

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the source code for a wedding website deployed via the v0.dev platform and hosted on Vercel. The website offers a user-friendly interface where guests can find event information, RSVP, and receive updates.

- **Wedding Date:** May 26
- **Live Site:** [Visit the Wedding Site](https://vercel.com/sschofield-microsoftcos-projects/v0-emily-matthew-s-wedding-may-26)
- **Edit \& Deploy on:** [v0.dev Project Interface](https://v0.dev/chat/projects/2WjcjU4XllF)


## How It Works

- The project is developed and updated using the [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) platform.
- Changes made via the v0.dev interface automatically sync with this GitHub repository.
- Upon syncing, Vercel continuously deploys the latest version of the site to the live URL.
- This seamless integration allows for rapid updates and easy collaboration.
